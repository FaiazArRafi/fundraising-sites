                    have devasted north-eastern Bangladesh this year. His entire village was hit with severe flooding
                    following the rainfall, leaving his home underwater. His family is sheltering in a school building,
                    without enough food. “I’ve only eaten dried rice with milk today because there are six of us and not
                    enough rations for all of us,” Sihab says.</p>
                <p class="para-color">Children like Sihab need your urgent support for emergency supplies, nutrition,
                    dry food storage,
                    clean water and hygiene kits. Join us to give hope and emergency relief to children like Sihab.</p>
